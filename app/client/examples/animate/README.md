This example shows how to use the sigma.plugins.animate plugin. It
creates a random graph with two different views:

The circular view displays the nodes on a circle, with each node
having a random color and a random size.

The grid view displays every nodes with the same size, and on a grid.

Every two seconds, the graph will be animated from a view to the other
one, in a one second animation.
