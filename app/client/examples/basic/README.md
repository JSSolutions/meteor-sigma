# Basic

This is a basic example on how to instantiate sigma. A random graph is
generated and stored in the "graph" variable, and then sigma is instantiated
directly with the graph.

The simple instance of sigma is enough to make it render the graph on the on
the screen, since the graph is given directly to the constructor.
