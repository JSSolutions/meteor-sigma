Just a simple example to show how to use the sigma.layout.forceAtlas2
plugin:

A random graph is generated, such that its nodes are separated in some
distinct clusters. Each cluster has its own color, and the density of
links is stronger inside the clusters. So, we expect the algorithm to
regroup the nodes of each cluster.
